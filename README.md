# Simple FFmpeg Player
A simple ffmpeg player for Windows and Linux.

## Description
This is the simplest way of programming player using ffmpeg libraries without additional dependencies. No SDL, no multithreading, no Boost and other stuff.
It uses only ffmpeg libraries for decoding video (without audio) and OpenGL for rendering.

## Building
By default all builds are debug. For windows build is statically linked with ffmpeg libraries.

### Windows
To build on Windows you need a C compiler. So you can install it with Visual Studio and after installation just run/click **build.bat**. All needed ffmpeg **.lib* files, headers files are included. You can find binary in *windows/bin* folder after compilation finished.

### Linux
To build on Linux you need a C compiler, X11 dev files and ffmpeg-dev libraries. For deb based distributions: **build-essential**, **libavformat-dev**, **libavcodec-dev**, **libswscale-dev**, **libgl-dev**.
Just run *build.sh* and you will find your binary in linux/bin.
